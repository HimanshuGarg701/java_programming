/*
For this problem, we'll round an int value up to the next multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is 5 or more,
so 15 rounds up to 20. Alternately, round down to the previous multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is less than 5,
so 12 rounds down to 10. Given 3 ints, a b c, return the sum of their rounded values.
To avoid code repetition, write a separate helper "public int round10(int num) {" and call it 3 times.
Write the helper entirely below and at the same indent level as roundSum().


roundSum(16, 17, 18) â†’ 60
roundSum(12, 13, 14) â†’ 30
roundSum(6, 4, 4) â†’ 10
